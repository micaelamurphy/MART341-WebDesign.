My user testability had its ups and downs. I couldn't remember how to make a live website on github, so I spent most of the week trying to figure out how to make that work. After that I chose to random people in my sorority and asked one of them to go on their phone and one to go on their computer with the link I had provided. After that the link didn't work, so I had to figure out where I went wrong and made changes to that. After it was all working both the person the phone and computer could see the website and they reported that it looked visually appealing. However, one person said I should change my gallery background and set up to look like the other pages, so I did that. They also said they couldn't really understand what the point of my website was, so for assignment 15 I am going to change up my about page to kind of explain why I did the website I did. They reported that overall it looked very aesthetically pleasing and the website was easy to navigate.

I decided to change the background of my gallery page since it was just plain orange before with no navigation bar at the top. I added the background image to the entire page as well as made the navigation bar. For week 15 I am going to change my about page so the website makes a little bit more sense.
