      Why Nike?
    </h1>
    <p>
      I chose to cover my favorite nike shoes because one of my favorite hobbies is collecting and researching different nike products. I like to keep the shoes in top quality as well as sell them when I don't wear them as much. For me, shoes are the way I express myself in my outfits. Usually I wear pretty color nuetral outfits, so I make sure my shoes always have a pop of color. I own over fifteen pairs of Nike shoes right now and plan to keep buying and selling the shoes.

      <h2>
        Advice to Beginners
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you are interested in starting to collect and sell shoes the best advice I've learned is to be patient. Selling shoes take some time, but there is someone ALWAYS interested. I also would advise to keep finances in mind. Sometimes, buying can be quite the expense, so only buy if you think you can afford it and then turn around and make a profit from the shoe. FInally, I would advise to always do research on the shoes you are buying, so you can be an informed buyer and upkeeper as well as a seller when the time comes to sell the shoe. Just enjoy the process!

      <p>
        On the gallery page you can find some of my favorite shoes I have owned and then sold for 50 dollars or higher than what I originally bought them for! Sometimes you can sell shoes for hundreds or even thousands more than what you bought them for! Nike is a highly known brand and people are always in the market for new shoes, so I never have to worry about the market running dry! If you have anymore questions feel free to contact us!
