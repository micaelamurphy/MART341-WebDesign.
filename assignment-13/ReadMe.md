The goal of my website is to let the user explore some different Nike shoes that are my personal favorites and learn the value of reselling shoes. I need to change my content in the paragraphs next week as well as add an additional page. I plan on doing an explore page that is almost interactive where you can click on the shoe and a paragraph pops down on the original price and then the resell value. I'm not quite sure how I am going to approach this yet. I also want to add all my style rules to my css from my three pages, but for some reason throughout the week it was very difficult for me to do this.


I think responsive web design is important because it caters to the needs of many different users such as a mobile phone user. That's what I focused on a lot in this weeks assignment when seeing if my website was accessible to a mobile phone and it was not. I went through the steps to shrink down my website when they are using a mobile phone so the style and the look of the website remained clean. It looked a lot better and you could see all the pictures as well as my back to the top menu button. Responsive web design is important to give the user an easy experience on all devices.
